# 💻 C Programming Practice Repository

## 🧾 About the Assignment

- Total Questions: **40**
- Language: **C**
- Topics: Covering everything from basic I/O to arrays, strings, recursion, file handling, and dynamic memory.
- Some of the programs include **comments written in Assamese** 🇮🇳 to make them more relatable and easy to understand for native learners.

## 📚 Topics Covered

Here’s a list of what the programs touch upon:

- ✅ Basic Input/Output
- 🔁 Conditional statements and loops
- 🧮 Functions and recursion
- 📦 Arrays and string manipulation
- 🧠 Pointer concepts and pointer arithmetic
- 📂 File handling (read/write/merge)
- 🏗️ Structures and dynamic memory (`malloc`, `free`)
- 📊 Sorting algorithms (like Bubble Sort)
- 🔢 Common logic-based programs (prime number, factorial, Fibonacci, etc.)

## 🗂 Program Structure

To keep the repository clean and organized, the 40 programs are grouped into three main files:

| File Name                | Description                                      |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `beginner_programs.c`    | Basic programs (I/O, operators, conditionals)    |
| `intermediate_programs.c`| Loops, functions, recursion, strings, pointers   |
| `advanced_programs.c`    | Arrays, sorting, structures, files, memory alloc |

Each program is written clearly and separately within those files, and you can scroll or search to find any specific one.
