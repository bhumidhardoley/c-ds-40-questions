# ðŸ’» C Programming Practice Repository

## ðŸ§¾ About the Assignment

- Total Questions: **40**
- Language: **C**
- Topics: Covering everything from basic I/O to arrays, strings, recursion, file handling, and dynamic memory.
- The programs include **comments written in Assamese** .
---

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

Hereâ€™s a list of what the programs touch upon:

-  Basic Input/Output
-  Conditional statements and loops
-  Functions and recursion
-  Arrays and string manipulation
-  Pointer concepts and pointer arithmetic
-  File handling (read/write/merge)
-  Structures and dynamic memory (`malloc`, `free`)
-  Sorting algorithms (like Bubble Sort)
-  Common logic-based programs (prime number, factorial, Fibonacci, etc.)

## ðŸ—‚ Program Structure

To keep the repository clean and organized, the 40 programs are grouped into three main files:

| File Name                | Description                                      |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `15_beginner_programs_c`    | Basic programs (I/O, operators, conditionals)    |
| `15_intermediate_programs_c`| Loops, functions, recursion, strings, pointers   |
| `10_advanced_programs_c`    | Arrays, sorting, structures, files, memory alloc |

Each program is written clearly and separately within those files, and you can scroll or search to find any specific one.
