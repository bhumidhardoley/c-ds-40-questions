# 💻 C Programming Practice Repository

Welcome to the **C Programming Practice Repository**!  
This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly and intermediate-level C programs, designed to help you understand the core concepts of the C language step by step.  

📝 Some programs also include comments in **Assamese** 🇮🇳 to make learning more accessible to native speakers.
